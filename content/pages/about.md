My name is Daniel Griffith.
I am a Data Scientist at [Minitab](http://minitab.com). This blog is mainly a vehicle I can use to help myself better understand the concepts that I am learning. If it ends up benefitting others, even better.

I have also linked to some conference presentations, and a few projects.  Hopefully, I'll add some more of my talks/projects shortly.
